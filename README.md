# Intro

This repository corresponds to the Alexa Skill "What The Pet". Inspired by the original Alexa Github repository [skill-sample-nodejs-decision-tree](https://github.com/alexa/skill-sample-nodejs-decision-tree).

The decision tree for this game looks like the one at `doc/alexa-skill-what-the-pet-decision-tree.png`.

Thank you Alexa Dev Team for creating the template. I merely "tweaked" it to make it a bit more fun. A nice experiment.

# Notes

Compress the files within the directory `src/` into a zip file. Upload to the AWS Lambda funtion to deploy.

The meat is the `src/index.js` file. First look into this file to learn how the Alexa skill work.
